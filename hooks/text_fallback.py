"""Plain-text boards for chat apps that can't draw blocks.

Hermes Desktop draws a `::blocks{id="..."}` line as a board. Telegram, Discord, the CLI and the rest would show that
line as it is, so the `transform_llm_output` hook (text_only) swaps each tag for a Markdown version of its board.

Everything here is shown in apps that render Markdown, and the blocks came from a model: control characters are
stripped, every string is capped, only http(s) URLs survive, and a block that can't be read is skipped, never raised.
Each type's own text is in blocks/<type>.py (text_<type>), listed in blocks.TYPES; this file walks a board and fits
the result into one message.
