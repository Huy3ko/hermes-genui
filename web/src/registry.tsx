// Every block type, in one place: how it is read from stored JSON and how it is drawn. readBlocks (core/readBlocks.ts)
// and the Blocks renderer (core/Blocks.tsx) both look types up here, so a type missing here is unknown: dropped, with
// a note. Adding a type is a folder in blocks/ plus a line in Block and a line in REGISTRY (see CONTRIBUTING.md).
